 - Message matching rules (so broadcasts can be filtered) need sorting
   out.

 - How we will handle DCOP needs sorting out. Among other things, we
   need to check that service and service-ownership semantics map to DCOP 
   reasonably well.

 - Activation needs some careful additional thinking-through.

 - Property list feature on message bus (list of properties associated 
   with a connection). May also include message matching rules 
   that involve the properties of the source or destination
   connection.

 - Implement all the needed resource limits to keep clients from
   killing the message bus.

 - Automatic service activation, should probably be done through a message flag.

 - Disconnecting the remote end on invalid UTF-8 is probably not a good 
   idea. The definitiion of "valid" is slightly fuzzy. I think it might 
   be better to just silently "fix" the UTF-8, or perhaps return an error.

   Owen says we should only validate the UTF-8 on dbus_message_get_string()
   (changing get_string to have an error return, and allowing a type error 
   as a possible return)

 - We might consider returning a "no such operation" error in dbus-connection.c 
   for unhandled messages.

 - The convenience functions in dbus-bus.h should perhaps have
   the signatures that they would have if they were autogenerated
   stubs. e.g. the acquire service function. We should also evaluate 
   which of these functions to include, in light of the fact that 
   GLib/Qt native stubs will probably also exist.

 - The message handler interface needs rethinking, perhaps handlers should be able 
   to return an error that automatically gets turned into a message; most likely 
   some basic spec'ing out of the GLib/Qt level stubs/skels stuff will be 
   needed to understand the right approach.

 - there are various bits of code to manage ref/unref of data slots, that should 
   be merged into a generic facility

 - assorted _-prefixed symbols in libdbus aren't actually used by
   libdbus, only by the message bus. These bloat up the library
   size. Not sure how to fix, really.

 - if you send a message to a service then block for reply, and the service exits/crashes
   after the message bus has processed your message but before the service has replied, 
   it would be nice if the message bus sent you an error reply.

 - write a DTD for the dbus-daemon-1 configuration file

 - build and install the Doxygen manual in Makefile when --enable-docs
