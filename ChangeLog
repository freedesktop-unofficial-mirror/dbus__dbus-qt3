	* Makefile.am: include "Doxyfile" target in all-local

	* configure.in: generate the Doxyfile

	* Doxyfile.in: move Doxyfile here, so we can use 
	configure to generate a Doxyfile with the right 
	version number etc.

	* dbus/dbus-message.c: move inline docs into .c file

	* Doxyfile (OUTPUT_DIRECTORY): move output to doc/api
	so all docs are under doc/
	(MAN_EXTENSION): generate man pages. Use extension 
	".3dbus" which matches ".3qt" on my system, 
	I guess this is OK, I don't know really.
	(FILE_PATTERNS): look for .c files not .h, makes sense
	for plain C I think

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): rename subdir "server" to "bus" 
	because any app can be a server, and any app can be a client, 
	the bus is a special kind of server.

	* Doxyfile : adding. Still needs Makefile rules to be generated
	automatically (just run "doxygen" in the toplevel dir for now to
	generate docs)
	
	* dbus/dbus-message.h : Adding sample docs (javadoc since
	resembles gtk-doc a little more)

	* dbus/dbus.h : Adding sample docs

2002-11-21  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* dbus/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): define DBUS_COMPILATION 
	so we can allow ourselves to include files directly, 
	instead of having to use dbus.h

	* dbus/dbus.h: fill in

	* dbus/dbus-message.h: sketch out a sample header file.
	Include griping if you include it directly instead of 
	via dbus.h

	* dbus/dbus-macros.h: new file with macros for extern "C", 
	TRUE/FALSE, NULL, etc.

	* doc/file-boilerplate.c: put include guards in here

2002-11-21  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* doc/file-boilerplate.c: include both AFL and GPL boilerplate.

	* COPYING: include the GPL as well, and license code 
	under both AFL and GPL.

	* acconfig.h: get rid of this

	* autogen.sh (run_configure): add --no-configure option

	* configure.in: remove AC_ARG_PROGRAM to make
	autoconf complain less. add AC_PREREQ. 
	add AC_DEFINE third arg.

	* doc/Makefile.am:
	Fix references so we can distcheck.

	* Initial module creation
