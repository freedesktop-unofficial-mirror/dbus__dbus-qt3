	* dbus/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): define DBUS_COMPILATION 
	so we can allow ourselves to include files directly, 
	instead of having to use dbus.h

	* dbus/dbus.h: fill in

	* dbus/dbus-message.h: sketch out a sample header file.
	Include griping if you include it directly instead of 
	via dbus.h

	TRUE/FALSE, NULL, etc.
