D-BUS is a simple IPC library based on messages.

Configuration flags
===

These are the configuration flags that can be given to the ./configure program.

--enable-qt      	enable Qt-friendly client library
--enable-glib    	enable GLib-friendly client library
--enable-tests  	enable unit test code
--enable-ansi    	enable -ansi -pedantic gcc flags
--enable-verbose-mode 	support verbose debug mode
--enable-asserts 	include assertion checks
--enable-gcov 		compile with coverage profiling instrumentation (gcc only)],enable_gcov=$enableval,enable_gcov=no)


Environment variables
===

These are the environment variables that are used by the D-BUS client library

DBUS_VERBOSE=1
Turns on printing verbose messages. This only works if D-BUS has been
compiled with --enable-verbose-mode

DBUS_MALLOC_FAIL_NTH=n
Can be set to a number, causing every nth call to dbus_alloc or
dbus_realloc to fail. This only works if D-BUS has been compiled with
--enable-tests.

DBUS_MALLOC_FAIL_GREATER_THAN=n
Can be set to a number, causing every call to dbus_alloc or
dbus_realloc to fail if the number of bytes to be allocated is greater
than the specified number. This only works if D-BUS has been compiled with
--enable-tests.


Tests
===

These are the test programs that are built if dbus is compiled using
--enable-tests.

dbus/dbus-test
This is the main unit test program that tests all aspects of the D-BUS
client library.

test/break-loader
A test that tries to break the message loader by passing it invalid messages.

test/bus-test
A test that simulates a bus daemon and tests it.
