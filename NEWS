  service can be launched automatically
- fix a bug in custom type marshaling
- optimize case where multiple apps activate the same service
  (avoid "thundering herd")
- add dynamic service file discovery/reloading
- fix a busy loop when blocking for a reply
- fix a 64-bit crash involving varargs
- fix a bus crash when processing an AcquireService

D-BUS 0.20
===

This release lands some very large API changes and numerous bugfixes.
The list of changes is too large to fully document here; please refer
to the documentation, and message-bus-list archives.

D-BUS 0.13
===

This is probably the last release before landing the large API changes
on the "dbus-object-names" branch.

- fix system bus to always use filesystem socket; anyone 
  can create any abstract socket, which isn't secure 
  since if you can crash the system bus you'd be able
  to replace it.
- add DTD for configuration file
- improve specification a bit

D-BUS 0.12
===

- fix "service messagebus status" on Red Hat
- fix demarshaling of DBUS_TYPE_NAMED
- fix "eval `dbus-launch --exit-with-session`" to exit properly
- fix build without --prefix
- useless fooling with Mono bindings
- useless fooling with gcj bindings
- fix srcdir != builddir
- fix various compiler warnings and other issues
- add get/set data to DBusMessage
- fix headers for C++
- OS X build fixes
- abstract domain sockets support (Linux only)
- add dbus-cleanup-sockets utility for people
  not using linux
- be consistent about defaulting to --session/--system 
  with command line tools
- merge in policies from included config files
- fix build on non-x86
- docs updates
- lots of other bugfixes

D-BUS 0.11
===

- add --enable-docs to turn off/on the docbook stuff
  (doesn't cover doxygen stuff yet)
- make people define DBUS_API_SUBJECT_TO_CHANGE
  and read warning in README so they don't 
  expect the API to be frozen already
- rename .pc files to "dbus-1.pc" instead of 
  "dbus-1.0.pc" etc. - this will require changing 
  pkg-config invocations
- some docs cleanups
- add man pages for all executables
- allow send to/from bus driver in the default system.conf
- fix user lookup bug
- implement dbus-launch to launch the session message bus
- fix some thread deadlocks
- some performance profiling/optimization
- add dbus_bus_activate_service() function
- fix some minor bugs here and there
- install Red Hat initscript in the right place

D-BUS 0.10
===

- reversed order of args to dbus_message_new()
- renamed dbus_message_name_is() and some other
  functions
- change DBusWatch to have dbus_watch_handle() 
  similar to dbus_timeout_handle(), drop 
  connection/server-specific handle routines
- change message serials to be unsigned
- implemented <allow>/<deny>/<limit> features for 
  config file; system bus now has a deny-all policy 
  by default.
- system.conf has <includedir>system.d</includedir>
  so packages can install additions to the default 
  policy to <allow> the messages they need. e.g.
  CUPS might install a cups.conf - see 
  test/data/valid-config-files/system.d/test.conf 
  for an example.
- add timeouts for authentication, activation
- add glib-style "checks" on public API, enable 
  those by default, disable assertions by default
- add GMainContext argument to GLib setup functions, 
  can be NULL for default context. Needed for threads.
- add 64-bit integer type
- validate type of standard message header fields
- consider messages in the org.freedesktop.Local
  namespace to be invalid (to avoid fake disconnect 
  messages for example)
- fix assorted memory leaks and other bugs in 
  the SHA-1 auth mechanism
- cache user database information (groups user is 
  in, etc.) helps a lot with NIS
- always store uid_t, pid_t, gid_t in "ulong" 
  rather than "int"
- implement config file settings for which 
  users can connect
- SHA-1 unit test
- dbus-send, dbus-monitor command line utilities
- fixed lots of misc crashes and other bugs

===

- implemented a test case for service activation,
  and fixed many bugs exposed by that
- implemented recursive argument marshaling/demarshaling

  dispatch status
